  <p>Several times have I tried to define an "about" page for myself. As of yet I haven't really been very successful, though this seems to be a great resourse to assist with the further creation of my back catalog of experience. Am I a developer? I developed this page, so in a sense, yes. Though in a broader sense of the question I am more a student trying to learn more about development than anything. I would relish the opportunity to be paid to do this, but that seems like a ways off at this moment in time... </p>
