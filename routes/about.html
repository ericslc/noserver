So I was super nervous about trying a new career path. The thought of starting over and trying to gain experience in a new field, trying to find a foothold in a different industry, and actually finding the time to become somewhat cometent in performing the roles within said industry is incredibly daunting. I feel like I have a long way to go, and once I am there, I will have a whole new world to learn again. It is incredibly exciting and I am really looking forward to the challenge.</p>
